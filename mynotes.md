# My Project Notes

## Intro
This file will include notes for me to progress.

## Ideas
* Garel and the other guy in the ESG covid paper use a measure of investor horizon that they compute using the 13F data. I could use this measure too and associate it to the ESG holdings. Maybe the more long term guys have shifted more away from polluting firms.

## This is a section
This should be the way to make lists:
* first element
  * second element
    *third element did not work
* And go back to initial bullet
