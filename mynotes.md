# Second Year Paper Notes

## Intro
This file will include notes for me to progress.

## Ideas
* Garel and the other guy in the ESG covid paper use a measure of investor horizon that they compute using the 13F data. I could use this measure too and associate it to the ESG holdings. Maybe the more long term guys have shifted more away from polluting firms.

## To-Do Plan

1. Find ESG rankings from Bloomberg and Datastream;
2. Figure out how to link CRSP and Compustat information and then link to S34 too (unless can use CCM merged);
3. Decide which info from Compustat you want to keep cause there are too many variables;
4. Merge together all the datasets;
5. Descriptive statistics on composition of portfolios in terms of green-ness and other characteristics;
6. Highlight change over time of green/sin holdings, by score and by sector;
7. Look at return differential between green and non-green investors, is there a transfer? 
I guess this will need to be done relative to a factor model for instance, to adjust for risk?
